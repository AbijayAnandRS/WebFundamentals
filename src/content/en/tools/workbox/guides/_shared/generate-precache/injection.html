<h3>Setup Injection</h3>

<p>Before you can inject a manifest into your service worker, you need to make sure
that your service worker file has the following snippet of code inside of it:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-javascript"><code>workbox.precaching.precacheAndRoute([]);</code></pre>

<p>This is needed since the Workbox tools will look for this snippet
and "inject" the list of assets to precache into the empty array.</p>

<p>Before you continue, make sure you add the above code into your service worker.</p>
